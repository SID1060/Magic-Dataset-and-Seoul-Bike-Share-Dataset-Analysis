# Magic Dataset and Seoul Bike Share Dataset Analysis
This repository contains Python code for analyzing the Magic Gamma Telescope Dataset and the Seoul Bike Share Dataset. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building machine learning models for predictive analytics. The code is organized into Google colab for easy understanding and reproducibility.

## Datasets:
* Bock,R.. (2007). MAGIC Gamma Telescope. UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C52C8B.
* Seoul Bike Sharing Demand. (2020). UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C5F62R.

### Highlights:

- Train/Validate/Test Dataset: The datasets are split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models.
- k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN): Implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm for classification or regression tasks.
- Multiple Linear Regression: Implementation of Multiple Linear Regression for predicting a continuous variable based on multiple input features.
- Naive Bayes: Implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm for classification tasks, assuming independence between features.
- Logistic Regression: Implementation of Logistic Regression for binary classification tasks.
- Support Vector Classification (SVC): Implementation of Support Vector Classification for classification tasks, using hyperplanes to separate classes.
- Neural Network: Implementation of a basic Neural Network using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for more complex classification or regression tasks.
- Regression with Neural Network: Using Neural Networks for regression tasks, predicting continuous variables.
- Neural Net: A more general term for Neural Networks, which can refer to various architectures and implementations.
